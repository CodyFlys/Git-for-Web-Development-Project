    1. What is Semantic HTML? - It gives meaning to the HTML tags and makes it easier to read when going over the markup. It also helps with SEO.
    2. What is HTML used for? - It is used to layout the structure of the website, the building blocks.
    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? - an attribute is more information about the element. Like an img tag attribute is src. It goes after the element tag.
    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page? - The h1 tag is heading 1 which is the biggest heading. It can be used as much as you see fit although it likely only needs to be used on key points of a site like the top of an article and then follow the titles of stories in the article with h2-h6.
    5. Name two tags that have required attributes - <img> and <html> both have some required attributes I believe. Like src and lang. 
    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? - we can import font types and other things like the title in there.
    7. What is an id? - An id is a selector. We can use it in html and CSS. In html we can use <h1 id="name"> and select it in css using #name however it is unique.
    8. What elements can I add an id to? - I believe we can add id's to any kind of element in html that we may want to style or pick out individually.
    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? - Once
    10. What is a class? - A class is another selecter like ID and used in the same way except the syntax is <h1 class="name"> and it's less unique.
    11. What elements can I add a class to? - I believe we can add a class to any html element we may want to style or pickout.
    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page? - As many as you would like.
    13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab? - target="_blank". I remember it by thinking of it opening a blank tab.
    14. What is the alt attribute used for? - It is used for accessibility purposes like screen readers to specify content like what an img looks like so someone who may be blind for example can still experience the site/images.
    15. How do I reference an id? - You would use a # symbole
    16. What is the difference between a section and a div - A section is semantic html and a div is less descriptive however both do the same thing and you will likely use both.
    17. What is CSS used for? - It's used to style HTML.
    18. How to we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page - h2 {

}
    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one - A class is used to target multiple elements potentially. Whilst an ID is used to target only 1 and can only be used 1 time on the page. So no 2 elements can share 1 ID name and get the same styles. But 1 class can style the entire set of elements on the page.

    20. How do we select classes in CSS? - We use a . selector
    21. How do we select a p element with a single class of “human””? - We would use p .human
    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful? - I believe an example of this would be something like selecting a nested element. for example .class-name h2 would select all h2's in the .class-name class.

    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar? - .sidebar a {}
    24. What is a pseudo selector? - It is used to select an element in a specific state like being hovered over or other possible states.
    25. What do we use the change the spacing between lines? - using line-height: %:
    26. What do we use to change the spacing between letters? - using letter-spacing: %;
    27. What do we use to to change everything to CAPITALS? lowercase? Capitalize? - we would used text-transform: one of 3;
    28. How do I add a 1px border around my div that is dotted and black? border: 1px dotted black;
    29. How do I select everything on the page? I believe we use a wild card selector which is * {}
    30. How do I write a comment in CSS? - we use /* COMMENT *\
    31. How do I find out what file I am in, when I am using the command line? - you use PWD
    32. Using the command line - how do I see a list of files/folders in my current folder? - You use LS
    33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this? - You use rm filename and you get no warning so you need to be careful.
    34. Why should I use version control? - So that multiple people can work on the same project but also merge back together. OR also because you can revert back to a working state of the code if anything happens to the site for example.
    35. How often should I commit to github? - When things are working and have been tested so probably around every 20 minutes or so.
    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github? - We would use git push but if it's for the school studies we use git push -u origin firstname-lastname
    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. We fork to get the repo on our own github, clone to copy the current state of the repo and get that clone to our local machine, add a TL to collabs so they can see., branch so we don't modify the master branch., make our changes, add, commit -M "changes made" and finally we push making sure we're on the student branch.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? - An inline element is typically used in-line and only uses as much space as needed such as a <span>. A block element typically breaks the line making a new "block" such as <div>.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? - I believe it means the element is now on it's own layer and does not interfer with the positions of other elements. (still need to look into this more.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? - maybe try display: inline-block;?
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default - some display block is div, ul, p and inline are span and img I believe. span and img tags are inline. inline-block example would be a button.
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? - box model represents the content, padding around it, border around that and the margin between all other elements. I'm not sure what the "fix" is?
